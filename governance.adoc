The objective of this document is to describe the process of decision
making and defines the social rules of interaction for our project.

== Communication

If you'd like to speak to maintainers of this project, you can reach us
through a bunch of different channels.

* *GitHub* On github.com, you can always notify the entire project team
by using the @github/Continuous-Architecture-Toolkit handle.
* *Slack* We're pretty active on slack.

== Roles and Responsibilities

* *Users* are community members who have a need for Continuous Architecture Toolkit. They are the most important members of the community and without them the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements. We asks users to participate in community and give us as much feedback as they can. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. +
See <<contributor.adoc,Contributor guide>> for more details.
* *Contributors* are community members who contribute in concrete ways to the project. It could be anyone who identify requirements, report issue, add value to the project with a merged pull request, evangelising or help the community to grow. +
See <<contributing.adoc,Contributor guide>> for more details.
* *Maintainers* are people responsible over the direction of the project and are committed to improving it in the long run. There are the only people in a project with commit access. 
See <<maintainer-guide/readme.adoc, Maintainer guide>> for more details. +
Maintainers are listed <<../readme.adoc#MAINTAINERS,here>>.

== Decision-Making process

The default decision making mechanism for the Continuous Architecture
Toolkit project is
http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#decision-making[lazy
consensus]. This means that any decision on issues is considered
supported by the core team as long as nobody objects.

Silence on any consensus decision is implicit agreement and equivalent
to explicit agreement. Explicit agreement may be stated at will.

If any team member raises objections, the team members work together
towards a solution that all involved can accept. This solution is again
subject to lazy consensus.

=== Commit Policy

To approve change proposals from contributors, Continuous Architecture
Toolkit projet apply the Review-Then-Commit policy which requires that
all pull-request changes receive
http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#decision-making[lazy
consensus] approval by maintainers, meaning at least one binding +1 vote
and no vetos (-1) in order to be committed.

=== Governance Committee

For other matters that need consensus like:

* Keep oversight of the pull-requests and ensure that the codebase does
not have copyright and license issues, and that the project is heading
in the desired direction.
* Keep oversight of the communication channels and community to ensure
that the open development ideals are upheld.
* Decide what is distributed as products of the project. In particular
all releases containd must be approved by the Governance Committe.
* Guide the direction of the project.
* Strive for and help to facilitate a harmonious productive community.
* Nominate new Governance Committee members (i.e. maintainers).
* Maintain the project's shared resources, including the codebase
repository, communications channels, websites.
* Speak on behalf of the project.
* Maintain these and other guidelines of the project

The Continuous Architecture Toolkit project uses a Governance Committee
Meeting as the primary forum of decision making. This meeting is
organized as required and conducted using a video call. Participation is
open to all maintainers. Agenda items can be added by any maintainers by
simply adding topics to the Governance Meeting Agenda.

Decisions are taken with a
http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#decision-making[lazy
consensus approach] except nominated maintainers membership.

=== Maintainer member status

Maintainer member status may be given to those who have made major
ongoing contributions to the Continuous Architecture toolkit for at
least 3 months. This is usually in the form of assets improvements
and/or notable work on documentation, but organizing events or community
support could also be taken into account.

New members may be proposed by any existing maitainers. It is highly
desirable to reach consensus about acceptance of a new member. However,
the proposal is ultimately voted on by a formal majority vote (requires
more binding +1 votes than binding -1 votes) during Governance
Committee.
