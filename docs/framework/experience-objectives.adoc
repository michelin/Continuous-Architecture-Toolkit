In a seminal HBR paper footnote:[Marketing Myopia
by Theodore Levitt, Harvard Business Review, Best of 1960] Theodore Levitt argues that companies are overly focused on producing goods
 or services and don’t spend enough time understanding what customers want or need. 
 Understanding the customer should come first, and designing the product should follow.

 and analyze customers' wants and needs.
