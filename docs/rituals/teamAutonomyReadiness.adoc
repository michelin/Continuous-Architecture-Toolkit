One of the key objective of Continuous Architecture operating model is to safely entrust product teams in taking architecture decisions to enable end-to-end ownership and continuous delivery. This means that we need to
 decentralize decision making around architecture while keeping the integrity of an information system which is usally compose of thousands of applications with a complex interweaving flows of data between them.

To achieve this objective and as different delivery teams require varying levels of oversight to successfully conduct architecture activities, C.A. operating model proposes a formal approach to evaluate their level of readiness for autonomy in taking architecture decisions based on the context. This assessmeent is done on a regular basis, over a 12 to 18 months horizon, during the xref:team-readiness-ritual[Team readiness for autonomy ritual] and formalize using the tool xref:team-readiness-poster[Team Autonomy readiness poster].

The tool propose 3 different levels of centralization/decentralization of architecture decisions which are:

* *Level 1*: The delivery team is autonomous to make the architectural decisions necessary for the evolution of the products it manages. Product & Fullstack architects provide support on-demand.
* *Level 2*: Architectural decisions are taken under the guidance of Product and Fullstack architects in charge of the domain/product line to which the product belongs. They lead the collaboration between all actors, ensure the end to end integrity and consistency of the system at scale while developing delivery teams judgement (coaching & mentoring) to increase their autonomy.
* *Level 3*: Architectural decisions need to be taken centraly under governance of enterprise architecture. EA architects educate architects community and delivery teams on new architecture considerations to increase their autonomy.

The level of readiness is defined delivery team by delivery team based on the assessment around 2 dimensions.

. On *Y* axis: the delivery team maturity regarding:
** knowledge and mastery of architecture guiderails (principles, blueprints & standards) of the organisation it belongs to.
** technical and functional skills assessment of the delivry team's members.
. on *X* axis: the level of architecture risks related to the product considering among other things:
** the stage of the product in its life cycle
** dependencies with other products and cross-team decisions needs
** security/legal consideration for the company
** level of investment
** sourcing that engage the company

TIP: Together, the team’s functional & technical maturity and the level of architecture risk determine its level of readiness to self-manage architectural decisions on products it manages.

As one of the responsability or the architect role in C.A. operating model is to educate delivery teams in design and architecture considerations, the assessment ritual is the opportunity to evaluate C.A practices adopted (the A symbol on the poster) and identify areas to improve with the delivery team (T symbol in the poster).

NOTE: ToDo: voir avec Nicolas comment mieux expliquer la partie droite du poster: La roue progress plan? la zone A/T ?

[[team-readiness-ritual]]
== The team autonomy readiness assessment ritual

Evaluation of teams autonomy readiness is done on a regular basis during this ritual animated and facilitated by the Product architect and the Fullstack architect for the product or line of product they have in charge of.

image::Continuous-architecture%20Generic%20Rituals%20-%20Readiness%20for%20Team%20Autonomy%20-%202020-2.png[Team Readiness for Autonomy]

The participants are usually, the Delivery Manager, the Lead Architect, the EA Architect and optionaly techical leaders and team leaders of delivery squads.

The main outcome of the meeting is obviously the assessement of teams formalized in the xref:team-readiness-poster[Team Autonomy readiness poster] but the dialogue between the parties is just as important. Possibly a specific organization and governance can be set up around architecture decisions for the related topic. And the ritual is also the oppotunity to update link:../../4.Practices/KIT%20Generic%20Progress%20Plan%202020.2.png[Continuous Architecture progress plans] and competences plans f]r delivery teams and architects as needed.

For preparation, Product/Fullstack architects have to consider following inputs:

* Products delivery roadmap for the next 12 to 18 months
* Last link:../../4.Practices/KIT%20Generic%20Progress%20Plan%202020.2.png[Continuous Architecture progress plans] review 
* Global architecture asssements of their product portfolio (level of obsolecence & IT Debt, alignment with architecture principles & blueprints, quality of service, quality of experience,...)
